Pagezii Blog SEO automatically creates detailed blog post metrics, including SEO scores, shares and reader profiles. Monthly author reports provide author metrics on most popular authors of the blog.

== Description ==

Pagezii Blog SEO is a must have plugin for Content Marketers using their WordPress blog for regular publishing. The Plugin automatically creates Blog Pulse and Author reports to indicate blog performance. The Pulse report contains vital stats, including post social performance, reader profile type and SEO score. The breakdown helps Content Marketers understand which content resonates with their blog readership. The monthly author report gives detailed metrics on authors active on the blog. Metrics include number of posts, average social shares, and SEO scores for the published blog posts.

#### Analyze your Blog ####
Pagezii Blog SEO is perfect tool for generating weekly and monthly reports on key blog performance metrics. It allows you to get a snapshot on your SEO score & target keywords post-by-post. It also provides social shares broken down by popular platforms, including LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter. Reader profiles give detailed metrics on your content - this helps optimize your communication style with your intended audiences.

#### Pagezii Reader Profiles ####
Pagezii Reader Profiles classify various communication styles based on reading ease and content complexity. Reader Profiles are inspired by standard readability tests (e.g. Flesch-Kincaid, SMOG, Gunning Fog, Automated Readability & Coleman-Liau) to grade content in a systematic manner. Reader Profiles help content writers optimize content so it well with their intended audiences.

#### Promote top Authors ####
The Monthly Author report breaks down author metrics, including number of posts from the author, the total shares generated by the posts and the SEO score for each post written by the Author. The report is an easy way to analyze each authors performance.

#### Year-to-Date Leaderboard ####
All posts published in the calendar year are analyzed and attributed to their authors under the leaderboard. This gives a running total of published Posts, Reader Views, Social Shares and SEO scores.

#### Gamification through Badges ####
Further details of the author reveal monthly and YTD metrics as well as milestone badges. These badges change from Red to Orange to Green, depending on the level of milestones reached. The gamification provides further motivation to your authors.
